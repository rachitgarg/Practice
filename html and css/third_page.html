    <div class="section_content">
      <p>A ship lives for the surf and not for the harbor. It certainly is safe at the harbor, but if all that one wanted was safety, one should've built a fortress and not a ship. This 'metal fish' is meant to brave the weather and long distances, to kiss the torrent waves and to slice through the rough waters at all times, its born to be at risk. Safety is the rust which shall tarnish the glint on its body, malign its grandiosity and reduce it to a goldfish, confined in a bowl to be admired, only.</p>
      <p>Life, similarly is a tale of the uncertainties that we face each day. There are ways to preserve it and keep it behind golden bars, but that's not what it’s meant for. There’s only one chance, one opportunity to live and experience, everything humanly possible.
        This chance shouldn’t be wasted on worrying about ‘a safe landing’ for every flight you take. </p>
        <p>Like the soil which faces the wrath of water and gets the shape of a delta, the pots that lie in the melting heat of the sun and get a structure that’s definite and strong, human life, faces the adversities, natural and manmade alike, and gets its meaning. Of what use would it be if it were to caged in safety, always. But taking the plunge is not always the best choice. Just when the mind is made up and the heart is racing, with a gush of adrenaline, a question arises, ’what if’? What if the golden bird flies away, what if the Titanic sinks, what if the delta is submerged…what if the life goes waste??  </p>
        <p>To make that choice between safety and risk, is a double edged sword. Always was and always will be. One wrong decision can lead empires to fall to dust. Battles are lost and fortunes are ruined. But who decides what is wrong and what is right? Here comes the role of gut feelings and perspicacity. There’s no rule of thumb to it, but your past experiences, your strength of character and perseverance define and shape what a decision might turn out to be…a boon or a bane. Everytime the need for taking an untrodden path arises; shying away mustn’t be an option because until one hasn’t walked upon it, how can he decide if it were a bliss or full of thorns? If it’s right, there’ll be pride and satisfaction. If it seems a mistake, there will also be a solution. For Shakespeare said,” One who doesn’t make a mistake, fails to make anything at all.”</p>
        <p>Thus, A ship may remain safe at the harbor, defying its nature, but until it touches the ocean and tastes the humid air, it is bound to stay aloof of its glory.</p>
